      <li><strong>What is your website about?</strong></li>
      <ul>
        My website will be about Formula 1.
      </ul>
      <li><strong>What is the objective of your website?</strong></li>
      <ul>
        The objective of this website is to inform readers about the history of
        the sport and the current situation that the sport finds itself.
      </ul>
      <li><strong>Who is your target audience?</strong></li>
      <ul>
        My target audience is The United States because of the growing
        popularity in the states. Formula 1 is already very popular in Europe
        but it's just now penetrating the US market and I want to teach them
        about Formula 1.

          website</strong
        >
      </li>
      <ul>
        I plan to include the current state of the 2023 championship that it's
        starting in March, the historic drivers from the past like Schumacher,
        Prost, Vettel, Senna and many others. I also want to include a page
        about news like deals and new teams that want to join Formula 1. For the
        last page I want to include the calendar of the 2023 Championship.
